Abelardo ep III Heloisae, dilectissimae sorori suae in Christo, Abaelardus, frater eius in ipso. Quod post nostram a saeculo ad Deum conuersionem nondum tibi aliquid consolationis uel exhortationis scripserim, non negligentiae meae, sed tuae, de qua semper plurimum confido, prudentiae imputandum est. Non enim eam his indigere credidi, cui abundanter quaecumque necessaria sunt diuina gratia impertiuit, ut tam uerbis scilicet quam exemplis errantes ualeas docere, pusillanimes consolari, tepidos exhortari, sicut et facere iam dudum consueuisti cum sub abbatissa prioratum obtineres. Quod si nunc tanta diligentia tuis prouideas filiabus, quanta tunc sororibus, satis esse credimus ut iam omnino superfluam doctrinam uel exhortationem nostram arbitremur. Sin autem humilitati tuae aliter uidetur, et in iis etiam quae ad Deum pertinent magisterio nostro atque scriptis indiges, super his quae uelis scribe mihi ut ad ipsam rescribam prout mihi Dominus annuerit. Deo autem gratias, qui grauissimorum et assiduorum periculorum meorum sollicitudinem uestris cordibus inspirans, afflictionis meae participes uos fecit ut orationum suffragio uestrarum diuina miseratio me protegat et \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"uelociter Satanam sub pedibus nostris conterat\\\\\\\\\". Ad hoc autem praecipue psalterium quod a me sollicite requisisti, soror in saeculo quondam cara, nunc in Christo carissima, mittere maturaui. In quo uidelicet pro nostris magnis et multis excessibus et quotidiana periculorum meorum instantia iuge Domino sacrificium immoles orationum. Quantum autem locum apud Deum et sanctos eius fidelium orationes obtineant, et maxime mulierum pro caris suis et uxorum pro uiris, multa nobis occurrunt testimonia et exempla. Quod diligenter attendens Apostolus sine intermissione orare nos admonet. Ex quibus uidelicet uerbis manifeste Dominus ipse profitetur orationes sanctorum quasi quoddam frenum irae ipsius immittere quo scilicet ipsa coerceatur ne, quantum merita peccantium exigunt, ipsa in eos saeuiat, et quem ad uindictam iustitia quasi spontaneum ducit, amicorum supplicatio flectat et tamquam inuitum quasi ui quadam retineat. Sic quippe oranti uel oraturo dicitur. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dimitte me et ne obsistas mihi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Praecipit Dominus ne oretur pro impiis. Orat iustus, Domino prohibente, et ab ipso impetrat quod postulat et irati iudicis sententiam immutat. Sic quippe de Moyse subiunctum est: Et \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"placatus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" factus \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"est Dominus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" de malignitate quam dixit \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"facere populo suo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Scriptum est alibi de uniuersis operibus Dei. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dixit, et facta sunt, Hoc autem loco et dixisse memoratur quod de afflictione populus meruerat et uirtute orationis praeuentus non implesse quod dixerat. Attende itaque quanta sit orationis uirtus, si quod iubemur oremus, quando id quod orare Prophetam Deus prohibuit, orando tamen obtinuit, et ab eo quod dixerat eum auertit. Cui et alius propheta dicit. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Et cum iratus fueris, misericordiae recordaberis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Audiant id atque aduertant principes terreni qui occasione praepositae et edictae iustitiae suae obstinati magis quam iusti reperiuntur, et se remissos uideri erubescunt, si misericordes fiant, et mendaces si edictum suum mutent, uel quod minus prouide statuerunt non impleant, et si uerba rebus emendent. Quos quidem recte dixerim Iephtae comparandos qui quod stulte uouerat stultius adimplens unicam interfecit. Qui uero eius membrum fieri cupit, <ei> cum Psalmista dicit. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Misericordiam et iudicium cantabo tibi, Domine; misericordia\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", sicut scriptum est, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"iudicium exaltat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", attendens quod alibi Scriptura comminatur. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Iudicium sine misericordia\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in eum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qui misericordiam non facit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Quod diligenter ipse Psalmista considerans, ad supplicationem uxoris Nabal Carmeli iuramentum quod ex iustitia fecerat, de uiro eius scilicet et ipsius domo delenda per misericordiam cassauit. Orationem itaque iustitiae praetulit et quod uir deliquerat supplicatio uxoris deleuit. In quo quidem tibi, soror, exemplum proponitur et securitas datur ut, si huius oratio apud hominem tantum obtinuit, quid apud Deum tua pro me audeat instruaris. Plus quippe Deus qui pater est noster filios diligit quam Dauid feminam supplicantem. Et ille quidem pius et misericors habebatur, sed ipsa pietas et misericordia Deus est. Et quae tunc supplicabat mulier saecularis erat et laica nec ex sanctae deuotionis professione Domino copulata. Quod si ex te minus ad impetrandum sufficias, sanctus qui te -cum est tam uirginum quam uiduarum conuentus, quod per te non potes, obtinebit. Cum enim discipulis Ueritas dicat. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ubi duo uel tres congregati fuerint in nomine meo, ibi sum in medio eorum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Et rursum: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Si duo ex uobis consenserint de omni re quam petierint, fiet illud a Patre meo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", quis non uideat quantum apud Deum ualeat sanctae congregationis frequens oratio? Si, ut Apostolus asserit, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"multum ualet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" oratio \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"iusti assidua\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", quid de multitudine sanctae congregationis sperandum est? Nosti, carissima soror, ex homilia beati Gregorii N_XXXVIII quantum suffragium inuito seu contradicenti fratri oratio fratrum mature attulerit. De quo iam ad extremum ducto, quanta periculi anxietate miserrima eius anima laboraret et quanta desperatione et taedio uitae fratres ab oratione reuocaret, quid ibi diligenter scriptum sit tuam minime latet prudentiam. Atque utinam confidentius te et sanctarum conuentum sororum ad orationem inuitet ut me scilicet uobis ipse uiuum custodiat, per quem, Paulo attestante, mortuos etiam suos de resurrectione mulieres(==--++) acceperunt. Si enim Ueteris et Euangelici Testamenti paginas reuoluas, inuenies maxima resuscitationis miracula solis uel maxime feminis exhibita fuisse, pro ipsis uel de ipsis facta. Duos quippe mortuos suscitatos ad supplicationes maternas Uetus commemorat Testamentum, per Eliam, scilicet, et ipsius discipulum Elisaeum(==--+-). Euangelium uero trium tantum mortuorum suscitationem a Domino factam continent quae mulieribus exhibita maxime illud quod supra commemorauimus, Apostolicum dictum rebus ipsis confirmant. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Acceperunt mulieres de resurrectione mortuos suos\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Filium quippe uiduae ad portam ciuitatis Naim suscitatum matri reddidit eius compassione compunctus. Lazarum quoque amicum suum ad obsecrationem sororum eius, Mariae uidelicet ac Marthae, suscitauit. Quo etiam archisynagogi filiae hanc ipsam gratiam ad petitionem patris impendente, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mulieres de resurrectione mortuos suos acceperunt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", cum haec uidelicet suscitata proprium de morte receperit corpus, sicut illae corpora suorum, Et paucis quidem interuenientibus hae factaesunt(==+--) resuscitationes. Uitae uero nostrae conseruationem multiplex uestrae deuotionis oratio facile obtinebit. Quarum tam abstinentia quam continentia Deo sacrata, quanto ipsi gratior habetur, tanto ipsum propitiorem(==---+-) inueniet. Et plerique fortassis horum qui suscitati sunt nec fideles exstiterunt, sicut nec uidua praedicta, cui non roganti filium Dominus suscitauit, fidelis exstitisse legitur. Nos autem inuicem non solum fidei colligat integritas, uerum etiam eiusdem religionis professio sociat. Ut autem sacrosanctum collegii uestri nunc omittam conuentum, in quo plurimarum uirginum ac uiduarum deuotio Domino iugiter deseruit, ad te unam ueniam, cuius apud Deum sanctitatem plurimum non ambigo posse, et quae potes mihi praecipue debere, maxime nunc in tantae aduersitatis laboranti discrimine. Memento itaque semper in orationibus tuis eius qui specialiter est tuus; et tanto confidentius in oratione uigila, quanto id esse tibi recognoscis iustius, et ob hoc ipsi qui orandusest(==++--) acceptabilius. Exaudi, obsecro, aure cordis, quod saepius audisti aure corporis.

Ad expletionem namque quotidie singularum horarum specialem pro me Domino supplicationem hanc offerre consueuit ut, responso proprio cum uersu eius praemissis et decantatis, preces his et collectam in hunc modum subiungeret. Responsum: Non me derelinquas, nec discedas a me, Domine, Uersus: In adiutorium meum semper intende, Domine; Preces: Saluum fac seruum tuum, Deus meus, sperantem in te, Domine exaudi orationem meam, et clamor meus ad te ueniat, Oratio: Deus qui per seruulum tuum ancillulas tuas in nomine tuo dignatus es aggregare, te quaesumus ut tam ipsi quam nobis in tua tribuas perseuerantiam uoluntate, Per Dominum, etc, Nunc autem absenti mihi, tanto amplius orationum uestrarum opus est suffragio, quanto maioris anxietate periculi constringor. Supplicando itaque postulo, postulando supplico quatinus praecipue nunc absens experiar quam uera caritas uestra erga absentem exstiterit, singulis uidelicet horis expletis, hunc orationis propriae modum adnectens. Responsum: Ne derelinquas me, Domine, pater et dominator uitae meae ut non corruam in conspectu aduersariorum meorum, ne gaudeat de me inimicus meus, Ex hac profecto, ut ita dicam, orationis improbitate, sicut supra memini, Moyses diuinae iustitiae seueritatem eneruauit, et sententiam immutauit. Quod si me Dominus in manus inimicorum tradiderit, scilicet, ut ipsi praeualentes me interficiant, aut quocumque casu uiam uniuersae carnis absens uobis ingrediar, cadauer, obsecro, nostrum ubicumque uel sepultum uel expositum iacuerit, ad coemeterium uestrum deferri faciatis ubi filiae uestrae, immo in Christo sorores, sepulcrum nostrum saepius uidentes, ad preces pro me Domino fundendas amplius inuitentur. Nullum quippe locum animae dolenti de peccatorum suorum errore desolatae tutiorem ac salubriorem arbitror quam eum qui uero Paraclito id est consolatori, proprie consecratus est, et de eius nomine specialiter insignitus. Nec Christianae sepulturae locum rectius apud aliquos fideles quam apud feminas Christo deuotas consistere censeo. Quae de domine Iesu Christi sepultura sollicitae eam unguentis pretiosis et praeuenerunt et subsecutae sunt et circa eius sepulcrum studiose uigilantes et sponsi mortem lacrymabiliter plangentes, sicut scriptum est. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Mulieres sedentes ad monumentum lamentabantur flentes Dominum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', Primo ibidem de resurrectione eius angelica apparitione et allocutione sunt consolatae, et statim ipsius resurrectionis gaudia, eo bis eis apparente, percipere meruerunt et manibus contrectare.

Uiue, uale, uiuant, que tuae ualeant , que sorores; Uiuite, sed Christo; quaeso, mei memores;Abelardi epistola V, Sponsae Christi seruus eiusdem. In quatuor, memini, circa quae tota epistolae tuae nouissimae summa consistit, offensae tuae commotionem expressisti. Primo quidem super hoc conquereris quod praeter consuetudinem epistolarum, immo etiam contra ipsum naturalem ordinem rerum, epistola nostra tibi directa te mihi in salutatione praeposuit. Secundo quod cum uobis consolationis potius remedium afferre debuissem, desolationem auxi, et quas mitigare debueram lacrymas excitaui, illud uidelicet ibidem adiungens. Tertio uero ueterem illam et assiduam querelam tuam in Deum adiecisti, de modo uidelicet nostrae conuersionis ad Deum et crudelitate proditionis illius in me commissae.Denique accusationem tui contra nostram in te laudem opposuisti, non cum supplicatione modica, ne id deinceps(==+-+) praesumerem. Quibus quidem singulis rescribere decreui non tam pro excusatione mea quam pro doctrina uel exhortatione tua, ut eo scilicet libentius petitionibus assentias nostris, quo eas rationabilius factas intellexeris, et tanto me amplius exaudias in tuis, quanto reprehensibilem minus inuenies in meis, tantoque amplius uerearis contemnere, quanto minus uideris dignum reprehensione.De ipso autem nostrae salutationis, ut dicis, ordine praepostero, iuxta tuam quoque, si diligenter attendas, actum est sententiam. Id enim quod omnibus patet, tu ipsa indicasti ut, cum uidelicet ad superiores scribitur, eorum nomina praeponantur. Te uero extunc me superiorem factam intelligas quo domina mea esse coepisti Domini mei sponsa effecta, iuxta illud beati Hieronymi ad Eustochium ita scribentis.

(-) Ac si aperte dicatur, ista iuncto latere, sponso familiarissime adhaeret et pariter incedit, ceteris omnibus quasi a longe absistentibus uel subsequentibus. De huius excellentia praerogatiuae sponsa in Canticis exsultans illa, ut ita dicam, quam Moyses duxit, Aethiopissa dicit: (-) Ideo dilexit me

feminis deformior; cum non sit tamen in interioribus dispar sed in plerisque etiam formosior atque candidior, sicut in ossibus seu dentibus. Quorum uidelicet dentium candor in ipso etiam commendatur sponso, cum dicitur: (-)Nigra itaque in exterioribus, sed formosa in interioribus est quia, in hac uita crebris aduersitatum tribulationibus corporaliter afflicta, quasi in carne nigrescit exterius, iuxta illud Apostoli (-)Sicut enim candido prosperum, ita non incongrue nigro designatur aduersum. Intus autem quasi in ossibus candet quia in uirtutibus eius anima pollet, sicut scriptum est: (-)  Ossa quippe, quae interiora sunt, exteriori carne circumdata, et ipsius carnis, quam gerunt uel sustentant, robur ac fortitudo sunt, bene animam exprimunt, quae carnem ipsam, cui inest, uiuificat,

fideles qui filiarum potius quam filiorum nomine digni sunt, dicit: (-)Ac si apertius dicat: Quod sic me humilio uel tam uiriliter aduersitates sustineo, non est meae uirtutis, sed eius gratiae cui deseruio.Aliter solent haeretici uel hypocritae, quantum ad faciem hominum spectat, spe terrenae gloriae sese uehementer humiliare, uel multa inutiliter tolerare. De quorum quidem huiusmodi abiectione uel tribulatione, quam sustinent, uehementer mirandum est, cum sint omnibus miserabiliores hominibus qui nec praesentis uitae bonis nec futurae fruuntur. Hoc itaque diligenter sponsa

id est, in secretum uel quietem contemplationis, et lectulum illum de quo eadem alibi dicit. (-)Ipsa quippe nigredinis deformitas occultum potius quam manifestum, et secretum magis quam publicum amat. Et quae talis est uxor, secreta potius uiri gaudia quam manifesta desiderat et in lecto magis uult sentiri quam in mensa uideri. Et frequenter accidit ut nigrarum caro feminarum quanto est in aspectu deformior, tanto sit in tactu suauior; atque ideo earum uoluptas secretis gaudiis quam publicis gratior sit et conuenientior, et earum uiri, ut illis oblectentur, magis eas in cubiculum introducunt quam ad publicum educunt.Secundum quam quidem metaphoram bene spiritalis sponsa, cum praemisisset: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nigra sum, sed

ut dixi, intus uirtutibus quas diligit sponsus; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nigra\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" exterius corporalium tribulationum aduersitatibus. Quae quidem nigredo, corporalium scilicet tribulationum, facile fidelium mentes ab amore terrenorum auellit et ad aeternae uitae desideria suspendit et saepe a tumultuosa saeculi uita trahit ad secretum contemplationis. Sicut in Paulo illo uidelicet nostrae, id est, monachalis uitae primordio actum esse beatus scribit Hieronymus(==-+--|JERONYMUS).Haec quoque abiectio indumentorum uilium secretum magis quam publicum appetit, ex maxima humilitatis ac secretioris loci, qui nostrae praecipue conuenit professioni, custodienda est.Maxime namque ad publicum procedere pretiosus prouocat cultus quem a nullo appeti nisi ad inanem gloriam et saeculi pompam beatus Gregorius inde conuincit: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Quod nemo his in occulto se ornat, sed ubi conspici queat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', Hoc autem praedictum sponsae cubiculum illud est ad quod ipse sponsus in Euangelio inuitat orantem, dicens: (-) Ac si diceret: Non in plateis uel publicis locis, sicut hypocritae.Cubiculum itaque dicit secretum a tumultibus et aspectu saeculi locum ubi quietius et purius orari possit; qualia sunt scilicet monasticarum solitudinum secreta ubi \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"claudere ostium\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" iubemur, id est aditus omnes obstruere ne puritas orationis casu aliquo praepediatur et oculus noster infelicem animam depraedetur.Cuius quidem consilii immo praecepti diuini multos huius habitus nostri contemptores adhuc grauiter sustinemus qui, cum diuina celebrant officia claustris uel choris eorum reseratis, publicis tam feminarum quam uirorum aspectibus impudenter se ingerunt, et tunc praecipue cum in solemnitatibus pretiosis polluerint ornamentis, sicut et ipsi quibus se ostentant saeculares homines.Quorum quidem iudicio tanto festiuitas habetur celebrior, quanto in exteriori ornatu est ditior et in epulis copiosior.De quorum quidem caecitate miserrima et pauperum Christi religioni penitus contraria tanto est silere honestius quanto loqui turpius. Qui penitus iudaizantes consuetudinem suam sequuntur pro regula, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"et irritum fecerunt mandatum Dei propter traditiones suas\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", non quod debeat, sed quod soleat attendentes.Cum, ut beatus etiam meminit Augustinus, Dominus dixerit: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ego sum ueritas\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", non: egosum(==+--) consuetudo(==++++|CONSVETUDO).Horum

ei totae uacatis, quanto familiarius ei adhaeretis, iuxta illud Apostoli: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Qui adhaeret Domino unus spiritus est\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", tanto puriorem et efficaciorem habere confidimus orationem et ob hoc uehementius earum efflagitamus opem.Quas etiam tanto deuotius pro me faciendas esse credimus, quanto maiore nos inuicem caritate colligati sumus.Quod uero mentione periculi in quo laboro, uel mortis quam timeo, uos commoui, iuxta ipsam quoque tuam factum est exhortationem, immo etiam adiurationem.Sic enim prima, quam ad me direxisti, quodam loco continet epistola. (-) Quid igitur arguis quod uos anxietatis meae participes feci, ad quod me adiurando compulisti? Numquid in tanta uitae, qua crucior, desperatione gaudere uos conuenit(==+--)?Nec doloris sociae, sed gaudii tantum, uultis esse, nec flere cum flentibus, sed gaudere cum gaudentibus?Nulla maior uerorum et falsorum differentia est amicorum quam quod illi aduersitati, isti prosperitati, se sociant.Quiesce, obsecro, ab his dictis, et huiusmodi querimonias compesce quae a uisceribus caritatis absistunt longissime.Aut si adhuc in his offenderis, me tamen in tanto periculi positum articulo, et quotidiana desperatione uitae, de salute animae sollicitum conuenit esse, et de ipsa, dum licet, prouidere.Nec tu, si me uere diligis, hanc exosam prouidentiam habebis.Quin etiam, si quam de diuina erga me misericordia spem haberes, tanto amplius ab huius uitae aerumnis liberari me cuperes, quanto eas conspicis intolerabiliores. Certum quippe tibi est quod quisquis ab hac uita me liberet, a maximis poenis eruet.Quas postea incurram incertum est, sed a quantis absoluar dubium non est. Omnis uita misera iucundum exitum habet, et quicumque aliorum anxietatibus uere compatiuntur et condolent, eas finiri desiderant, et cum damnis etiam suis, si quos anxios uident uere diligunt, nec tam commoda propria quam illorum in ipsis attendunt.Sic diu languentem filium mater etiam morte languorem finire desiderat, quem tolerare ipsa non potest, et eo potius orbari sustinet quam in miseria consortem habere.Et quicumque amici praesentia plurimum oblectatur magis tamen beatam esse uult eius absentiam quam praesentiam miseram, quia quibus subuenire non ualet, aerumnas tolerare non potest.Tibi uero nec nostra uel etiam misera concessum est frui praesentia.Nec nisi tuis in me commodis aliquid prouideas, cur me miserrime uiuere malis quam felicius mori non uideo.Quod si nostras protendi miserias in commoda tua desideras, hostis potius quam amica conuinceris.Quod si uideri refugis, ab his obsecro, sicut dixi, quiesce querimoniis.Approbo autem quod reprobas laudem quia in hoc ipso te laudabiliorem ostendis.Scriptum est enim: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Iustus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in primordio \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accusator est sui\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; et: (-)Atque utinam sic sit in animo tuo sicut et in scripto! Quod si fuerit, uera est humilitas tua nec pro nostris euanuerit uerbis.Sed uide, obsecro, ne hoc ipso laudem quaeras quo laudem fugere uideris et reprobes illud ore quod appetas corde.De quo ad Eustochium uirginem sic inter cetera beatus scribit Hieronymus.(-)  Antequam lateat cupit se fugientem uideri, ut ipsa fuga qua reprobare consortium iuuenis uidetur amplius acquirat.Sic et laudes hominum, dum fugere uidemur, amplius erga nos excitamus et, cum latere nos uelle simulamus ne quis scilicet in nobis quid laudet agnoscat, amplius attendimus in laudem nostram impudentes quia eo laude uidemur digniores.Et haec quidem quia saepe accidunt dicimus non quia de te talia suspicemur qui de tua non haesitamus humilitate.Sed ab his etiam uerbis te temperare uolumus ne his, qui te minus nouerint, uidearis, ut ait Hieronymus: fugiendo gloriam quaerere.Numquam te mea laus inflabit sed ad meliora prouocabit, et tanto studiosius quae laudauero amplecteris, quanto mihi amplius placere satagis.Non est laus nostra testimonium tibi religionis ut hinc aliquid extollentiae sumas.Nec de commendatione cuiusquam amicis credendum est sicut inimicis deuituperatione(==----+-+-).Superest tandem ut ad antiquam illam, ut diximus, et assiduam querimoniam tuam ueniamus qua uidelicet de nostrae conuersionis modo Deum potius accusare praesumis quam glorificare, ut iustum est, uelis.Hanc iamdudum amaritudinem animi tui tam manifesto diuinae misericordiae consilio euanuisse credideram.Nec de commendatione cuiusquam amicis credendum est sicut inimicis de uituperatione. Quae, quanto tibi periculosior est, corpus tuum pariter et animam conterens, tanto miserabilior est et mihi molestior. Quae cum mihi per omnia placere, sicut profiteris, studeas, hoc saltem uno ut me non crucies, immo ut mihi summopere placeas, hanc depone, cum qua mihi non potes placere neque me -cum ad beatitudinem peruenire.Sustinebis illuc me sine te pergere, quem etiam ad Uulcania profiteris te sequi uelle? Hoc saltem uno religionem appete ne a me ad Deum, ut credis, properantem diuidaris; et tanto libentius, quanto quo ueniendum nobis est beatius est, ut tanto scilicet societas nostra sit gratior, quanto felicior.Memento quae dixeris; Recordare quae scripseris in hoc uidelicet nostrae conuersionis modo, quo mihi Deus amplius aduersari creditur, propitiorem mihi sicut manifestumest(==--+-+) exstitisse. Hoc uno saltem haec eius dispositio tibi placeat quod mihi sit saluberrima immo mihi pariter et tibi, si rationem uis doloris admittat.Nec te tanti boni causam esse doleas, ad quod te a Deo maxime creatam esse non dubites.Nec quia id tulerim plangas, nisi cum martyrum passionum ipsius -que Dominicae mortis commoda te contristabunt.Numquid si id mihi iuste accidisset, tolerabilius ferres, et minus te offenderet?Profecto si sic fieret, eo modo contingeret quo mihi esset ignominiosius, et inimicis laudabilius, cum illis laudem iustitia et mihi contemptum acquireret culpa, nec iam quisquam quod actum est accusaret, aut compassione mei moueretur.Ut tamen et hoc modo huius amaritudinem doloris leniamus, tam iuste quam utiliter id monstrabimus nobis accidisse, et rectius in coniugatos quam in fornicantes ultum Deum fuisse.Nosti post nostri foederationem coniugii, cum Argenteoli cum sanctimonialibus in claustro conuersareris, me die quadam priuatim ad te uisitandam uenisse, et quid ibi te -cum meae libidinis egerit intemperantia in quadam etiam parte ipsius refectorii, cum quo alias uidelicet diuerteremus, non haberemus.Nosti, inquam, id impudentissime tunc actum esse in tam reuerendo loco et Summae Uirgini consecrato.Quod, et si alia cessent flagitia, multo grauiore dignumsit(==+--) ultione.Quid pristinas fornicationes et impudentissimas referam pollutiones quae coniugium praecesserunt? Quid summam denique proditionem meam, qua de te ipsa tuum, cum quo assidue in eius domo conuiuebam, auunculum tam turpiter seduxi?Quis me ab eo iuste prodi non censeat quem tam impudenter ante ipse prodideram?Putas ad tantorum criminum ultionem momentaneum illius plagae dolorem sufficere?Immo tantis malis tantum debitum esse commodum?Quam plagam diuinae sufficere iustitiae credis ad tantam contaminationem, ut diximus, sacerrimi loci suae matris?Certe, nisi uehementer erro, non tam illa saluberrima plaga in ultionem horum conuersa est quam quae quotidie indesinenter sustineo. Nosti etiam, quando te grauidam in meam transmisi patriam, sacro te habitu indutam monialem te finxisse, et tali simulatione tuae, quam nunc habes, religioni irreuerenter illusisse. Unde etiam pensa quam conuenienter ad hanc te religionem diuina iustitia, immo gratia traxerit nolentem, cui uerita non es illudere, uolens ut in ipso luas habitu quod in ipsum deliquisti, et simulationis mendacio ipsa rei ueritas remedium praestet et falsitatem emendet.Quod si diuinae in nobis iustitiae nostram uelis utilitatem adiungere, non tam iustitiam quam gratiam Dei quod tunc egit in nobis poteris(==---) appellare.Attende itaque, attende, carissima, quibus misericordiae suae retibus a profundo huius tam periculosi maris nos Dominus piscauerit et a quantae Charibdis uoragine naufragos licet inuitos extraxerit ut merito uterque nostrum in illam prorumpere posse uideatur uocem: (-) Cogita et recogita in quantis ipsi nos periculis constitueramus et a quantis nos eruerit Dominus et narra semper cum summa gratiarum actione \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"quanta fecit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Dominus \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"animae nostrae\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; et quoslibet iniquos de bonitate Domini desperantes nostro consolare exemplo, ut aduertant omnes quid supplicantibus atque petentibus fiat, cum tam peccatoribus et inuitis tanta praestentur beneficia.Perpende altissimum in nobis diuinae consilium pietatis, et quam misericorditer iudicium suum Dominus in correptionem uerterit et quam prudenter malis quoque ipsis usus sit et impietatem pie deposuerit ut unius partis corporis mei iustissima plaga duabus mederetur animabus. Confer periculum et liberationis modum, confer languorem et medicinam, meritorum causas inspice et miserationis affectus admirare.Nosti quantis turpitudinibus immoderata mea libido corpora nostra addixerat ut nulla honestatis uel Dei reuerentia in ipsis etiam diebus Dominicae passionis uel quantarumcumque solemnitatum ab huius luti uolutabro me reuocaret.Sed et te nolentem et, prout poteras, reluctantem et dissuadentem, quae natura infirmior eras, saepius minis ac flagellis ad consensum trahebam.Tanto enim tibi concupiscentiae ardore copulatus eram ut miseras illas et obscenissimas uoluptates, quas etiam nominare confundimur, tam Deo quam mihi ipsi praeponerem; nec iam aliter consulere posse diuina uideretur clementia, nisi has mihi uoluptates sine spe ulla omnino interdiceret. Unde iustissime et clementissime, licet cum summa tui auunculi proditione, ut in multis crescerem, parte illa corporis mei sum imminutus in qua libidinis regnum erat et tota huius concupiscentiae causa consistebat ut iuste illud plecteretur membrum quod in nobis commiserat totum et expiaret patiendo quod deliquerat oblectando et ab his me spurcitiis, quibus me totum quasi luto immerseram, tam mente quam corpore circumcideret; et tanto sacris etiam altaribus idoneorem efficeret, quanto me nulla hinc amplius carnalium contagia pollutionum reuocarent. Quam clementer etiam in eo tantum me pati uoluit membro, cuius priuatio et animae saluti consuleret, et corpus non deturparet, nec ullam officiorum ministrationem praepediret.Immo ad omnia, quae honeste geruntur, tanto me promptiorem efficeret, quanto ab huius concupiscentiae iugo maximo amplius liberaret.Cum itaque membris his uilissimis, quae pro summae turpitudinis exercitio pudenda uocantur, nec proprium sustinent nomen, me diuina gratia mundauit potius quam priuauit, quid aliud egit quam ad puritatem munditiae conseruandam sordida remouit et uilia?Hanc quidem munditiae puritatem nonnullos sapientium uehementissime appetentes inferre etiam sibi manum audiuimus ut hoc a se penitus remouerent concupiscentiae flagitium.Pro quo etiam stimulo carnis auferendo et Apostolus perhibetur \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominum rogasse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", nec exauditum esse.In exemplo est magnus ille Christianorum philosophus Origenes qui, ut hoc in se penitus incendium exstingueret, manus sibi inferre ueritus non est; ac si illos ad litteram uere beatos intelligeret, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qui se ipsos propter regnum coelorum castrauerunt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", et tales illud ueraciter implere crederet quod de \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"membris scandalizantibus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nos praecipit Dominus ut ea scilicet a nobis \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abscindamus et proiiciamus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", et quasi illam Isiae prophetiam ad historiam magis quam ad mysterium duceret, per quam ceteris fidelibus eunuchos Dominus praefert, dicens. (-) Culpam tamen non modicam Origines incurrit dum per poenam corporis remedium culpae quaerit, zelum quippe \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dei habens, sed non secundum scientiam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", homicidii incurrit reatum, inferendo sibi manum.Suggestione diabolica uel errore maximo id ab ipso constat esse factum, quod miseratione Dei in me est ab alio perpetratum. Culpam euito, non incurro, mortem mereor et uitam assequor.Uocor et reluctor, Insto criminibus et ad ueniam trahor inuitus.Orat Apostolus nec exauditur, precibus instat nec impetrat.Uere \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominus sollicitus est mei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Uadam igitur \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"et narrabo quanta fecit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Dominus animae meae.Accede et tu, inseparabilis comes, in una gratiarum actione, quae et culpae particeps facta es et gratiae.Nam et tuae Dominus immemor salutis, immo plurimum tui memor, qui etiam sancto quodam nominis praesagio te praecipue suam fore praesignauit, cum te uidelicet Heloissam id est diuinam ex proprio nomine suo quod est Heloim insigniuit; ipse, inquam, clementer disposuit in uno duobus consulere quos diabolus in uno nitebatur exstinguere. Paululum enim antequam hoc accideret, nos indissolubili lege sacramenti nuptialis inuicem astrinxerat, cum cuperem te mihi supra modum dilectam in perpetuum retinere, immo cum ipse iam tractaret ad se nos ambos hac occasione conuertere(==++--).Si enim mihi antea matrimonio non esses copulata, facile in discessu meo a saeculo uel suggestione parentum uel carnalium oblectatione uoluptatum saeculo inhaesisses.Uide ergo quantum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sollicitus nostri fuerit Dominus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", quasi ad magnos aliquos nos reseruaret usus, et quasi indignaretur aut doleret illa litteralis scientiae talenta, quae utrique nostrum commiserat, ad sui nominis honorem non dispensari; aut quasi etiam de incontinentissimo seruulo suo uereretur quod scriptum est: quia (-) sicut et de sapientissimo certumest(==+-+) Salomone.Tuae uero prudentiae talentum quantas quotidie Domino refert usuras, quae multas Domino iam spirituales filias peperisti, me penitus sterili permanente, et in filiis perditionis inaniter laborante.O quam detestabile damnum, Quam lamentabile incommodum, si carnalium uoluptatum sordibus uacans paucos cum dolore pareres mundo, quae nunc multiplicem prolem cum exsultatione parturis coelo!Nec esses plus quam femina nunc etiam uiros transcendis et quae maledictionem Euae in benedictionem uertisti Mariae. O quam indecenter manus illae sacrae, quae nunc etiam diuina reuoluunt uolumina, curae muliebris obscenitatibus deseruirent! Ipse nos a contagiis HUIUS caeni, a uoluptabris huius luti dignatus est erigere, et ad se ipsum ui quadam attrahere, qua percussum uoluit Paulum conuertere, et hoc ipso fortassis exemplo nostro alios quoque litterarum peritos ab hac deterrere praesumptione. Ne te id igitur, soror, obsecro, moueat, nec patri paterne nos corrigenti sis molesta, sed attende quod scriptum est: (-) Poena haec momentanea est non aeterna, purgationis, non damnationis. Audi prophetam et confortare: (-) Attende summam illam et maximam Ueritatis adhortationem: (-) Unde et Salomon: (-) Non te ad lacrymas aut ad compunctionem mouet unigenitus Dei innocens pro te et omnibus ab impiissimis comprehensus, distractus, flagellatus et uelata facie illusus et colaphizatus, sputis conspersus, spinis coronatus, et tandem in illo crucis tunc tam ignominioso patibulo inter latrones suspensus
